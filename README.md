This is a quiz I created for my students to test their knowledge of English language articles. 

The quiz shuffles the questions in the array everytime it starts ensuring different questions are displayed each time. 

More questions will be added to the array, as well as a progress bar which will display which question you are on/how many questions you have left. 

Enjoy!
