This is a quiz I created for my students to test their knowledge of English language articles. 

The quiz shuffles the questions in the array everytime it starts ensuring different questions are displayed each time. 

The problems with the background are caused by it being animated. Animating it and positioning properly ase the parent of the other elements in the HTML would cause inheritance issue which are unsolvable. Despite my best efforts animating the background causes so many issues that I will create a second version of this quiz with a simple background that won't have a rediculous CSS file with a billion attempts at fixing the background problems. 

Enjoy!
